The application facilitates real-time communication between users via a graphical user interface (GUI) in JAVA, communicating with a Python-based server over UDP protocol.

The client-side, implemented in JAVA, comprises three main files. The ClientUDP.java file handles socket programming, managing communication with the server. ClientGUI.java configures the graphical elements and user interface components. 
The Python-based server manages the communication channel and relays messages between clients. The combination of Java and Python enables seamless chat interactions between users within the application's graphical environment, facilitating real-time communication over UDP.
